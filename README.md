# `http_ece` - HTTP Encrypted Content-Encoding for Deno & web browsers

This library is an implementation of HTTP Encrypted Content-Encoding
scheme([RFC 8188](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8188)).

## Implemented schemes

This crate implements only the published Web Push Encryption scheme, and **not**
the legacy scheme from earlier drafts.

It does not support, and we have no plans to ever support, the obsoletes
`aesgmc` and `aesgcm128` schemes from earlier drafts.
